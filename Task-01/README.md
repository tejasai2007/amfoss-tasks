In the first it was hard to cope with it . but eventually got used on how to get with the hints and continue .In the first part i thought to use bit-bucket instead of github since i dont know how to use github.but i used github since one of the  senior suggested it .Even in task two i took a suggestion from him to complete it .coming to the point first i got to know that 6 is the first perfect number .THen solved the equation and found the spell.but in my linux the code did not run . So i used cat to read the Whole code.I used cd and cd .. command most often in all the parts not only part 1.in the Partt-2 i got confused with two of the elements.So i used both of them.one atomic number was 14 and the other was 32.i got Wrong with both.I continued with other and completed the rest . i texted the senior all the parts and asked which one was wrong. he suggested rto recheck my second part since the author of the question chose to pick the second answer. then i got the answer in otal.
the list of the commands i used is:
1. ls
2. cd
3. cd ..
4. git checkout
5. git cat
6. git nano
7. gedit(due to confusion)
8. git add
9. git status
10. git commit -m""
11. git push
